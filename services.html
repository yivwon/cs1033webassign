                <h3 class="service-title">Gel Manicure</h3>
                <p>A gel manicure is a service that uses a gel-based polish and requires a UV or LED light to cure the polish and lock it onto your nails. Gel polish is more durable than regular polish and will last 2-3 weeks.</p>
                <h3 class="service-title">Gel-X Nail Extensions</h3>
                <p>Gel-X extensions are a healthier alternative to acrylic nails. They are made of a soft gel that is cured with a UV or LED light. Gel-X extensions are thinner and more flexible than acrylic nails, making them more comfortable to wear.</p>
                <h3 class="service-title">Acrylic Full Set</h3>
                <p>Acrylic nails are a combination of a liquid monomer and a powder polymer that create a hard protective layer over your natural nails. Acrylics are perfect for people who want to lengthen their nails or add strength to their natural nails.</p>
                <h3 class="service-title">Acrylic Fill</h3>
                <p>An acrylic fill is a service that fills in the gap between your cuticle and the existing acrylic as your natural nail grows out. This service is typically done every 2-3 weeks to maintain the look and integrity of your acrylic nails.</p>
