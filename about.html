                            <h1>About Me</h1>
                            <p>I graduated from Elegance Schools Inc. in 2022, where I completed my full-time esthetics program diploma, as well as certificates in laser hair removal, electrolysis, and gel nails. From this program, I discovered that nails and facials were my two favorite services, and I wanted to build on them and continue learning more advanced techniques. I love doing nails and creating beautiful nail art. I started my own business focusing on nails in May 2024, and now I am expanding to include facials and spray tans.</p>
                            <p>I am passionate about the medical aesthetics world and truly believe in the effectiveness of medical-grade skincare. I have seen firsthand how much they can help. I'm working with Erika at NEWWay Aesthetics to continue my education and deepen my understanding of skin and skin therapy while also providing facials under NEWWay. Whether you are looking for a maintenance facial, light face resurfacing, or seeking advice on acne, aging, etc., we will help you determine the best course of action for your concerns. I have over seven certificates in the aesthetics industry and will continue to learn, grow, and add to that.</p>
                            <p>Outside of work, I love spending time with my friends and family, checking out new cafes, places to eat, markets, and going to Pilates or workout classes.</p>
