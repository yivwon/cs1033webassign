                <p>As a newcomer to the salon scene, I bring fresh ideas and a commitment to excellence. I studied at Elegance Schools in London, Ontario. I started out doing nails and have recently expanded to facials and spray tans. I am thrilled to be apprenticing as a skin therapist with Erika at NEWWay Aesthetics.</p>

But wait... expanding into facials and helping clients achieve the results they are looking for with their skin has made me even more excited about the field of medical aesthetics. I think I am going to love giving you healthy, glowing skin just as much as I love making your nails pop!</p>
